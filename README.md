You can download the app from the Releases section or as a ZIP file. Windows might warn you that the installer is a virus since it's not signed—just click "More info" and then "Run anyway" to continue.
The app uses Gemini 1.5 Flash latest. You’ll need to enter your Gemini API key to get started if you want AI features. You can grab one from: https://aistudio.google.com/
Sorry for the AI code indentation issues. Trying to patch it up now.
