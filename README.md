You can download the app from the Releases section or as a ZIP file. Windows might warn you that the installer is a virus since it's not signed—just click "More info" and then "Run anyway" to continue.
The app uses Gemini 1.5 Flash latest. You’ll need to enter your Gemini API key to get started. You can grab one from: https://aistudio.google.com/
